# GridSnip<br>

---problem<br>

When 3d modelling, it is common to use orthographic reference images.<br>
It is convenient to make certain images symmetrical (ex: front view, back view, eyeball).<br>
Which meant opening the image in another program, such as Photoshop, to crop the image.<br>
An unnecessary bottleneck.<br>

---solution<br>

Take a screenshot, lining up the X-Y axes as you like, save the image<br>
all in one tool<br>

tested with windows 10<br>
